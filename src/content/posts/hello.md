# Hey, welcome!

I'm JT from Canada 🇨🇦. For over a decade, I've been tinkering with code—sometimes building websites, sometimes playing with robots, sometimes diving into AI/ML, and lately even poking around with operating systems just for fun. I just really like making things and seeing what I can learn along the way.

This blog is my new little corner of the internet to share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and whatever else I find cool or useful. Expect a mix of web dev, tech experiments, and the occasional random project. No pressure, just sharing for the fun of it (and maybe to help someone out).

If you want to chat, swap ideas, or just say hi, my inbox is always open. Thanks for stopping by!
